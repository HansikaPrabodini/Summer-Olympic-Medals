# Developing a Machine Learning Model for Medal Prediction

Developing a machine learning model for medal prediction aims to forecast how many medals
a country might win based on various factors. By using historical Olympic data, I will train the
model with features such as a country's previous performance, economic indicators,
population, and whether they are hosting.
This approach helps identify patterns and trends, allowing for more accurate medal
predictions for future Olympics. Through this process, I will evaluate model accuracy and
refine predictions to better understand the key drivers of Olympic success.

### Data Selection and Splitting:
#### Selected Data Range: 1992 to 2020
Reasoning: Chose this range to include data from after the dissolution of the Soviet Union
(which ended in 1991) to ensure consistent country identifiers and data accuracy.
#### Training Set: 1992 to 2016
Purpose: To build the model using historical data and trends up to the 2016 Olympics.
#### Test Set: 2020
Purpose: To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and predictive accuracy on the most recent
Olympic data.

### Features Plan to Use:
#### Demographic and Economic Indicators:
Total Population
Population Growth
GNI per Capita
GDP
GDP Growth
GDP per Capita
% World Population
% World GDP
Year
#### Olympic-Specific Metrics:
Total Athletes Each Year By Country
Total Events Each Year By Country
Host Country Status (Host or Not)
#### Geographical and Developmental Factors:
Region
HDI (Human Development Index)
#### Dependent Variable (Y):
Total Medals Each Year By Country
